- **HTTP Client**: Axios

## Component Breakdown and Responsibilities

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **App.tsx**
- Root component that sets up the application layout
- Provides Redux store to the entire application
- Manages the overall page structure with header and content areas

#### 2. **JobPostForm.tsx** (`src/components/JobPostForm.tsx`)
- Handles job post creation with comprehensive form validation
- Features:
  - Form fields: Job Title, Department, Employment Type, Description, Location, Deadline
  - Real-time validation with custom rules
  - Loading states during submission
  - Success/error notifications
  - Automatic form reset after successful submission
- Integrates with Redux for state management

#### 3. **JobPostsList.tsx** (`src/components/JobPostsList.tsx`)
- Displays all created job posts in a list format
- Features:
  - Loading states while fetching data
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Empty state when no posts exist
  - Responsive card-based layout
  - Color-coded employment type tags
  - Formatted dates and metadata

### Backend Components

#### **Scalable Architecture**
The backend now follows a modular, scalable architecture:

```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── app.js              # Express app configuration
│   ├── config/             # Configuration files
│   │   └── index.js        # Central config
│   ├── controllers/        # Request handlers
│   │   └── jobPost.controller.js
│   ├── middleware/         # Custom middleware
│   │   ├── errorHandler.js
│   │   └── requestLogger.js
│   ├── models/            # Data models
│   │   └── jobPost.model.js
│   ├── routes/            # API routes
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── jobPost.routes.js
│   ├── services/          # Business logic
│   │   └── jobPost.service.js
│   └── utils/             # Utility functions
│       └── asyncHandler.js
└── server.js              # Entry point
```

#### **Key Components:**

1. **server.js**: Entry point that starts the Express server with graceful shutdown handling

2. **app.js**: Express application setup with middleware configuration and route mounting

3. **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
   - `jobPost.controller.js`: Manages all job post endpoints

4. **Services**: Business logic layer
   - `jobPost.service.js`: Handles job post CRUD operations with validation

5. **Routes**: API endpoint definitions
   - Versioned API structure (`/api/v1/`)
   - RESTful endpoints for job posts

6. **Models**: Data structure definitions
   - `jobPost.model.js`: Defines job post schema and validation

7. **Middleware**:
   - `errorHandler.js`: Centralized error handling
   - `requestLogger.js`: Request/response logging

#### **API Endpoints**
- Base URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /job-posts`: Retrieve all job posts
  - `POST /job-posts`: Create a new job post
  - `GET /job-posts/:id`: Retrieve a specific job post
  - `PUT /job-posts/:id`: Update a job post
  - `DELETE /job-posts/:id`: Delete a job post
  - `GET /health`: API health check

### State Management

#### **Redux Store** (`src/store/index.ts`)
- Centralized state management using Redux Toolkit
- Single slice for job posts management

#### **Job Posts Slice** (`src/store/reducers/jobPostsSlice/index.ts`)
- Manages job posts state with async thunks
- State shape:
  ```typescript
  {
    posts: JobPost[],
    loading: boolean,
    error: string | null,
    createStatus: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error',
    createError: string | null
  }
  ```
- Actions: fetch posts, create post, reset status

### Custom Hooks

#### **useJobPosts** (`src/hooks/useJobPosts.ts`)
- Provides easy access to job posts state and actions
- Encapsulates Redux dispatch and selector logic
- Returns posts data and action methods

## Data Handling and Validation

### Form Validation Rules
1. **Job Title**: Required, minimum 3 characters
2. **Department**: Required
3. **Employment Type**: Required, must be one of: Full-time, Part-time, Internship
4. **Job Description**: Required, minimum 50 characters
5. **Location**: Required
6. **Application Deadline**: Required, must be a future date

### Data Flow
1. User fills out the job post form
2. Form validation occurs on the client side
3. Valid data is sent to the backend API
4. Backend validates required fields
5. Job post is stored in memory with auto-generated ID and timestamp
6. Success response triggers UI update
7. Redux store is updated with the new post
8. List view automatically reflects the new addition

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "message": string,
  "data": JobPost | JobPost[]
}
```

## Known Limitations and Improvement Areas

### Current Limitations
1. **Data Persistence**: Uses in-memory storage - data is lost on server restart
2. **Authentication**: No user authentication or authorization
3. **Search/Filter**: No ability to search or filter job posts
4. **Pagination**: All posts are loaded at once
5. **Edit Functionality**: Cannot edit existing job posts

### Future Improvements
1. **Database Integration**: Implement PostgreSQL or MongoDB for persistent storage
2. **Edit Job Post Feature**: 
   - Add edit button to each job post
   - Reuse JobPostForm component with pre-filled values
   - Add PUT endpoint to update posts
3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Job post status management (draft, published, archived)
   - Application tracking
   - Email notifications
4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Input sanitization
   - Rate limiting
   - Authentication and authorization
   - HTTPS implementation
5. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for API
   - End-to-end testing

## Running the Application

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
Server runs on http://localhost:5000

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Application runs on http://localhost:3000

## Architecture Notes

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation between:
- **Presentation Layer**: React components with Ant Design
- **State Management Layer**: Redux Toolkit
- **API Layer**: Axios-based API client
- **Backend Service Layer**: Express routes and handlers

This modular approach makes it easy to extend functionality, swap implementations, and maintain the codebase as it grows.
